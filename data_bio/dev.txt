Oh O
, O
my O
first O
foster O
case O
! O

It O
was O
back O
in O
1975 B-TIME
, O
and O
I O
had O
just O
graduated O
. O

The O
agency O
assigned O
me O
to O
a O
young O
boy O
named O
Tommy B-PERSON
. O

He O
was O
only O
seven B-TIME
years O
old O
, O
and O
he O
had O
been O
through O
so O
much O
for O
someone O
so O
young O
. O

I O
was O
nervous O
but O
eager O
to O
make O
a O
difference O
. O

Yes O
, O
it O
really O
did O
. O

It O
was O
both O
heartbreaking O
and O
eye-opening O
. O

Tommy O
was O
such O
a O
sweet O
kid O
, O
despite O
everything O
he O
'd O
been O
through O
. O

I O
spent O
countless O
hours O
trying O
to O
connect O
with O
him O
, O
gaining O
his O
trust O
little O
by O
little O
. O

Well O
, O
as O
time O
went O
on O
, O
I O
started O
taking O
on O
more O
cases O
. O

By O
the O
late B-TIME
'80s I-TIME
, O
I O
was O
handling O
a O
full O
caseload O
, O
and O
it O
was O
intense O
. O

But O
, O
over O
time O
, O
it O
started O
to O
take O
a O
toll O
on O
me O
. O

The O
system O
was O
tough O
, O
and O
I O
began O
to O
feel O
the O
burnout O
creeping O
in O
. O

It O
was O
indeed O
challenging O
. O

By O
the O
time O
the O
early B-TIME
'90s I-TIME
rolled O
around O
, O
I O
realized O
I O
could O
n't O
keep O
going O
at O
the O
same O
pace O
without O
burning O
out O
completely O
. O

I O
had O
a O
supervisor B-PERSON
who O
suggested O
I O
take O
a O
leave O
of O
absence O
. O

It O
was O
the O
best O
decision O
. O

It O
ultimately O
led O
me O
to O
make O
some O
significant O
changes O
, O
including O
shifting O
my O
focus O
and O
eventually O
adopting O
a O
child B-PERSON
. O

Oh O
, O
those O
years O
were O
quite O
something O
! O

The O
bureaucracy O
was O
another O
challenge O
. O

There O
were O
so O
many O
regulations B-EVENT
and O
red O
tape O
that O
sometimes O
made O
it O
difficult O
to O
get O
the O
resources O
the O
kids O
needed O
. O

It O
was O
a O
real O
struggle O
to O
balance O
my O
empathy O
with O
the O
harsh O
realities O
of O
the O
system O
. O

Ah O
, O
adopting O
a O
child O
! O

That O
was O
a O
pivotal O
moment O
in O
my O
life O
. O

I O
started O
the O
process O
and O
eventually O
adopted O
a O
little O
girl O
named O
Sarah B-PERSON
. O

She O
was O
eight B-TIME
years O
old O
at O
the O
time O
. O

Bringing O
her O
into O
my O
life O
was O
one O
of O
the O
most O
rewarding O
things O
I O
've O
ever O
done O
. O

Oh O
, O
it O
certainly O
did O
! O

Sarah O
and O
I O
have O
had O
quite O
the O
journey O
together O
. O

Watching O
her O
grow O
into O
this O
amazing O
, O
resilient O
young O
woman O
has O
been O
one O
of O
the O
greatest O
joys O
of O
my O
life O
. O

If O
there O
's O
one O
lesson O
I O
've O
learned O
throughout O
my O
life O
and O
career O
, O
it O
's O
the O
importance O
of O
resilience O
and O
compassion O
. O

Do O
n't O
underestimate O
the O
impact O
of O
your O
actions O
, O
however O
small O
they O
may O
seem O
. O

It O
's O
the O
love O
and O
support O
we O
give O
and O
receive O
that O
truly O
shapes O
our O
lives O
. O

Ah O
, O
yes O
. O
I O
remember O
those O
early O
days O
vividly O
. O

It O
was O
in O
a O
small O
workshop B-LOCATION
in O
my O
hometown O
in O
Germany B-LOCATION
. O

I O
must O
have O
been O
around O
14 B-TIME
or O
15 B-TIME
. O

My O
father B-PERSON
was O
a O
clockmaker B-OCCUPATION
, O
and O
every O
day O
after O
school O
, O
I O
'd O
rush O
to O
his O
workshop O
. O

He O
was O
patient O
but O
firm O
. O

He O
'd O
show O
me O
the O
intricacies O
of O
each O
gear B-ARTIFACT
, O
how O
they O
meshed O
together O
to O
keep O
time O
. O

It O
was O
fascinating O
to O
see O
how O
such O
small O
parts O
could O
create O
such O
a O
precise O
instrument O
. O

Indeed O
, O
it O
was O
. O

Working O
with O
my O
father O
was O
more O
than O
just O
learning O
a O
trade O
; O
it O
was O
like O
unlocking O
a O
world O
of O
secrets O
. O

Each O
gear O
, O
each O
tick O
of O
the O
clock B-ARTIFACT
seemed O
to O
hold O
a O
story O
. O

My O
father O
had O
a O
quiet O
way O
of O
teaching—he O
'd O
often O
say O
, O
'The O
clock O
will O
tell O
you O
what O
it O
needs O
if O
you O
listen O
closely O
. O
' O

We O
did O
n't O
just O
work O
; O
we O
shared O
a O
passion O
. O

That O
connection O
made O
the O
hours O
pass O
like O
minutes O
. O

Things O
began O
to O
change O
when O
the O
Quartz B-EVENT
Crisis I-EVENT
came O
along O
. O

It O
was O
around O
the O
1970s B-TIME
, O
and O
suddenly O
, O
these O
new O
quartz B-ARTIFACT
watches I-ARTIFACT
were O
everywhere O
. O

They O
were O
cheaper O
to O
make O
, O
more O
precise O
, O
and O
did O
n't O
need O
winding O
. O

It O
felt O
like O
the O
world O
was O
moving O
away O
from O
the O
craftsmanship O
that O
I O
knew O
and O
loved O
. O

Many O
of O
us O
, O
traditional O
clockmakers B-PERSON
, O
were O
worried O
. O

Our O
skills O
, O
honed O
over O
decades O
, O
seemed O
to O
be O
losing O
their O
value O
. O

Yes O
, O
it O
was O
a O
difficult O
time O
. O

Many O
of O
us O
felt O
like O
we O
were O
being O
left O
behind O
. O

I O
remember O
having O
long O
discussions O
with O
fellow O
clockmakers O
. O

We O
were O
all O
trying O
to O
figure O
out O
how O
to O
adapt O
. O

Some O
started O
incorporating O
quartz B-ARTIFACT
movements I-ARTIFACT
into O
their O
designs O
, O
but O
it O
never O
quite O
felt O
the O
same O
. O

The O
artistry O
, O
the O
soul O
of O
clockmaking O
, O
seemed O
to O
be O
slipping O
away O
. O

It O
was O
a O
melancholy O
period O
, O
watching O
something O
so O
beautiful O
and O
intricate O
being O
overshadowed O
by O
mass O
production O
and O
efficiency O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
tried O
. O

Many O
of O
us O
did O
. O

I O
focused O
more O
on O
repairing O
antique B-ARTIFACT
clocks I-ARTIFACT
, O
which O
kept O
the O
old O
art O
alive O
in O
some O
way O
. O

There O
was O
a O
niche O
market O
for O
it O
, O
people O
who O
appreciated O
the O
history O
and O
the O
craftsmanship O
. O

It O
was O
n't O
the O
same O
as O
creating O
a O
new O
timepiece O
from O
scratch O
, O
but O
it O
was O
something O
. O

It O
allowed O
me O
to O
keep O
working O
with O
those O
gears O
I O
loved O
so O
dearly O
, O
to O
keep O
the O
stories O
alive O
. O

But O
it O
was O
a O
struggle O
, O
watching O
the O
younger O
generation O
gravitate O
toward O
the O
quartz O
watches O
and O
digital B-ARTIFACT
displays I-ARTIFACT
. O

Sometimes O
, O
it O
felt O
like O
shouting O
into O
the O
wind O
. O

Well O
, O
as O
I O
mentioned O
, O
I O
turned O
to O
repairing O
antiques O
. O

There O
was O
a O
certain O
satisfaction O
in O
bringing O
life O
back O
to O
these O
old O
clocks O
, O
ones O
that O
had O
been O
ticking O
for O
generations O
. O

It O
was O
like O
connecting O
with O
the O
past O
, O
understanding O
the O
craftsmanship O
of O
those O
who O
came O
before O
me O
. O

I O
found O
solace O
in O
knowing O
that O
there O
were O
still O
people O
who O
valued O
this O
art O
, O
even O
if O
they O
were O
few O
. O

I O
also O
began O
teaching O
younger O
enthusiasts B-PERSON
who O
were O
interested O
in O
the O
traditional O
methods O
. O

It O
was O
heartening O
to O
see O
their O
eyes O
light O
up O
with O
the O
same O
wonder O
I O
had O
when O
I O
was O
a O
boy O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
am O
. O

I O
still O
spend O
my O
days O
surrounded O
by O
these O
beautiful O
, O
old O
timepieces B-ARTIFACT
. O

Each O
one O
has O
its O
own O
quirks O
and O
challenges O
, O
and O
I O
take O
great O
care O
in O
restoring O
them O
to O
their O
former O
glory O
. O

It O
's O
a O
slow O
, O
meticulous O
process O
, O
but O
there O
's O
a O
peace O
in O
it—a O
rhythm O
, O
almost O
like O
a O
heartbeat O
. O

And O
every O
time O
I O
hear O
a O
clock O
chime O
again O
after O
being O
silent O
for O
so O
long O
, O
it O
feels O
like O
I O
've O
given O
it O
a O
second O
life O
. O

Working O
on O
these O
old O
clocks O
brings O
me O
a O
deep O
sense O
of O
peace O
. O

There O
's O
something O
meditative O
about O
the O
process O
, O
the O
way O
each O
gear O
fits O
perfectly O
into O
the O
next O
. O

It O
's O
a O
reminder O
of O
a O
time O
when O
things O
were O
made O
to O
last O
, O
when O
precision O
and O
patience O
were O
key O
. O

In O
many O
ways O
, O
these O
clocks O
have O
become O
dear O
friends O
. O

They O
hold O
stories B-EVENT
within O
them O
, O
and O
I O
feel O
a O
responsibility O
to O
preserve O
those O
stories O
. O

It O
's O
a O
fulfilling O
way O
to O
spend O
my O
days O
, O
even O
if O
the O
world O
outside O
moves O
at O
a O
different O
pace O
. O

Yes O
, O
my O
perspective O
on O
time O
has O
evolved O
quite O
a O
bit O
. O

When O
you O
're O
young O
, O
time O
seems O
infinite O
, O
does O
n't O
it O
? O

But O
as O
I O
grew O
older O
, O
working O
with O
these O
clocks O
, O
I O
began O
to O
see O
time O
differently O
. O

Each O
clock O
, O
each O
tick O
, O
is O
a O
reminder O
of O
how O
fleeting O
moments O
are O
. O

These O
clocks O
have O
been O
around O
for O
generations O
, O
some O
longer O
than O
I O
've O
been O
alive O
, O
yet O
they O
keep O
on O
ticking O
, O
marking O
the O
passage O
of O
time O
. O

It O
's O
humbling O
. O

Standing O
in O
their O
presence O
, O
I O
often O
think O
about O
my O
own O
time O
, O
what O
's O
left O
, O
and O
how O
I O
choose O
to O
spend O
it O
. O

Working O
with O
them O
has O
taught O
me O
patience O
and O
the O
value O
of O
living O
in O
the O
moment O
. O

In O
a O
world O
that O
's O
always O
rushing O
, O
these O
clocks O
remind O
me O
to O
slow O
down O
and O
appreciate O
each O
tick O
. O

Ah O
, O
a O
final O
lesson O
... O
I O
'd O
say O
it O
's O
to O
appreciate O
the O
beauty O
in O
the O
small O
things O
and O
take O
the O
time O
to O
understand O
them O
. O

Life O
is O
much O
like O
a O
clock O
with O
its O
many O
gears—each O
small O
piece O
plays O
its O
part O
, O
and O
together O
, O
they O
create O
something O
extraordinary O
. O

It O
's O
easy O
to O
get O
caught O
up O
in O
the O
rush O
, O
but O
if O
you O
listen O
closely O
, O
much O
like O
my O
father O
used O
to O
say O
, O
'The O
clock O
will O
tell O
you O
what O
it O
needs O
. O
' O

In O
those O
quiet O
moments O
, O
there O
's O
clarity O
. O

Treasure O
the O
details O
, O
the O
stories O
they O
hold O
, O
and O
the O
time O
you O
have O
, O
for O
it O
's O
precious O
and O
fleeting O
. O

It O
was O
in O
the O
late B-TIME
70s I-TIME
, O
during O
a O
tour O
with O
the O
ballet B-ORGANIZATION
company I-ORGANIZATION
. O

We O
were O
in O
Paris B-LOCATION
. O

I O
decided O
to O
stay O
. O

I O
felt O
trapped O
, O
you O
know O
? O

The O
restrictions O
, O
the O
constant O
surveillance O
. O

In O
Paris B-LOCATION
, O
I O
saw O
freedom O
. O

It O
was O
an O
opportunity O
I O
couldn O
’ O
t O
pass O
up O
. O

It O
was O
difficult O
at O
first O
. O

I O
missed O
my O
family B-PERSON
, O
my O
friends B-PERSON
. O

But O
the O
ballet B-ORGANIZATION
community I-ORGANIZATION
here O
was O
welcoming O
. O

They O
helped O
me O
find O
my O
footing O
. O

Things O
really O
changed O
when O
I O
injured O
my O
knee B-ARTIFACT
. O

It O
was O
a O
turning O
point O
. O

During O
a O
rehearsal B-EVENT
, O
I O
landed O
awkwardly O
after O
a O
jump O
. O

It O
was O
immediate O
pain O
, O
and O
I O
knew O
it O
was O
bad O
. O

The O
hardest O
part O
was O
accepting O
that O
my O
career B-EVENT
as O
a O
performer O
was O
over O
. O

The O
doctors B-PERSON
said O
I O
would O
n't O
dance O
again O
professionally O
. O

I O
had O
to O
find O
a O
new O
purpose O
. O

Teaching O
became O
my O
focus O
. O

Transitioning O
was O
n't O
easy O
. O

I O
had O
to O
learn O
patience O
. O

Teaching O
is O
different O
; O
you O
guide O
others O
rather O
than O
express O
yourself O
. O

Teaching O
kids B-PERSON
is O
rewarding O
. O

They O
have O
so O
much O
energy O
and O
potential O
. O

It O
feels O
good O
to O
pass O
on O
what O
I O
've O
learned O
. O

Looking O
back O
, O
I O
see O
it O
as O
a O
full O
circle O
. O

I O
miss O
performing O
, O
but O
teaching O
gives O
me O
a O
sense O
of O
purpose O
I O
did O
n't O
expect O
. O

I O
hope O
I O
've O
inspired O
them O
. O

That O
's O
all O
a O
teacher O
can O
ask O
for O
. O

There O
's O
a O
student B-PERSON
who O
went O
on O
to O
join O
a O
professional B-ORGANIZATION
company I-ORGANIZATION
. O

Seeing O
them O
succeed O
felt O
like O
a O
piece O
of O
my O
own O
journey O
continued O
. O

Never O
stop O
learning O
. O

Life O
will O
change O
, O
and O
you O
must O
adapt O
. O

Embrace O
every O
stage O
. O

Oh O
, O
those O
were O
the O
days O
! O

Back O
in O
the O
late B-TIME
'60s I-TIME
and O
early B-TIME
'70s I-TIME
, O
we O
were O
just O
a O
bunch O
of O
young O
cats O
, O
crammed O
into O
this O
beat-up O
old O
van B-ARTIFACT
, O
chasing O
the O
music O
wherever O
it O
took O
us O
. O

We O
did O
n't O
have O
much O
, O
just O
our O
instruments B-ARTIFACT
, O
a O
few O
bucks O
, O
and O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
passion O
. O

It O
did O
n't O
matter O
as O
long O
as O
we O
were O
playing O
. O

Oh O
, O
it O
was O
an O
adventure O
every O
single O
day O
, O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
! O

Often O
, O
we O
'd O
sleep O
in O
the O
van B-LOCATION
or O
crash O
at O
someone O
's O
place O
if O
they O
offered O
. O

I O
remember O
one O
night O
, O
we O
were O
stuck O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
nowhere O
because O
the O
van B-ARTIFACT
broke O
down O
. O

Instead O
of O
getting O
upset O
, O
we O
just O
took O
out O
our O
instruments B-ARTIFACT
and O
started O
jamming O
right O
there O
by O
the O
roadside B-LOCATION
. O

Ah O
, O
yes O
, O
things O
did O
start O
to O
change O
as O
we O
moved O
into O
the O
'80s B-TIME
. O

But O
what O
really O
shook O
me O
was O
this O
one O
time O
when O
I O
started O
to O
notice O
I O
was O
having O
trouble O
hearing O
certain O
notes O
. O

I O
remember O
sitting O
in O
a O
doctor B-LOCATION
’ I-LOCATION
s I-LOCATION
office I-LOCATION
, O
just O
sweating O
bullets O
, O
thinking O
about O
what O
I O
would O
do O
if O
I O
couldn O
’ O
t O
play O
anymore O
. O

Music B-EVENT
was O
everything O
to O
me O
; O
it O
was O
my O
identity O
. O

Absolutely O
, O
it O
was O
a O
real O
wake-up O
call O
. O

I O
started O
playing O
just O
for O
myself O
. O

I O
would O
sit O
down O
with O
my O
guitar B-ARTIFACT
and O
just O
let O
my O
fingers O
move O
over O
the O
strings B-ARTIFACT
, O
not O
worrying O
about O
gigs O
or O
audiences O
. O

Thankfully O
, O
my O
hearing O
stabilized O
, O
and O
I O
did O
n't O
lose O
it O
completely O
. O

Oh O
, O
it O
evolved O
quite O
a O
bit O
. O

I O
started O
to O
focus O
more O
on O
the O
quality O
of O
my O
music O
rather O
than O
just O
playing O
as O
many O
gigs B-EVENT
as O
possible O
. O

It O
was O
also O
around O
this O
time O
that O
I O
started O
teaching O
younger O
musicians B-OCCUPATION
. O

Every O
time O
I O
played O
, O
it O
was O
like O
a O
reminder O
of O
how O
precious O
it O
was O
to O
still O
have O
my O
hearing O
and O
my O
ability O
to O
make O
music O
. O

Well O
, O
these O
days O
, O
music O
is O
my O
constant O
companion O
. O

Now O
, O
it O
's O
just O
me O
and O
my O
guitar B-ARTIFACT
, O
and O
sometimes O
a O
few O
friends B-PERSON
who O
join O
in O
for O
the O
fun O
of O
it O
. O

I O
play O
to O
remember O
the O
good O
times O
, O
to O
process O
the O
challenges O
, O
and O
to O
find O
peace O
in O
the O
moments O
of O
solitude O
. O

Oh O
, O
it O
's O
a O
completely O
different O
feeling O
, O
almost O
like O
coming O
full O
circle O
. O

Back O
then O
, O
music O
was O
about O
energy O
, O
excitement O
, O
and O
sharing O
it O
with O
the O
world O
. O

Now O
, O
it O
's O
about O
introspection O
and O
connection O
with O
myself O
. O

There O
's O
a O
certain O
peace O
in O
knowing O
that O
I O
can O
still O
create O
without O
the O
need O
for O
validation O
from O
an O
audience B-PERSON
. O

That O
's O
a O
big O
question O
, O
but O
I O
think O
if O
there O
's O
one O
thing O
I O
've O
learned O
, O
it O
's O
that O
music B-EVENT
is O
more O
than O
just O
a O
career O
or O
a O
hobby—it O
's O
a O
lifelong O
companion O
. O

It O
's O
there O
during O
the O
highs O
and O
the O
lows O
, O
and O
it O
can O
teach O
you O
a O
lot O
about O
yourself O
if O
you O
let O
it O
. O

So O
my O
advice O
would O
be O
to O
embrace O
it O
in O
whatever O
form O
it O
comes O
to O
you O
, O
and O
do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
to O
let O
it O
guide O
you O
through O
the O
twists O
and O
turns O
of O
life O
. O

It O
's O
about O
finding O
your O
voice O
, O
your O
sound O
, O
and O
letting O
it O
resonate O
with O
who O
you O
are O
. O
