She was a bit shy and reserved at first, which was understandable given her past. But over time, as we built trust and formed our bond, she really started to come out of her shell. I remember our first family vacation—it was just a simple weekend trip, but it was such a milestone for us. We laughed, explored, and just enjoyed being together without any worry about the past. Watching her grow into this amazing, resilient young woman has been one of the greatest joys of my life. She's now pursuing her own dreams, and I couldn't be prouder of her.",

Life throws us challenges, and it's easy to feel overwhelmed. But I've come to realize that there's immense power in staying steadfast and compassionate, both to others and to ourselves. Every child I worked with, every case I handled, taught me that even the smallest acts of kindness can make a world of difference. And adopting Sarah reinforced this belief. It showed me that love has the power to heal and transform. So, I would say, don't underestimate the impact of your actions, however small they may seem. Keep going, keep believing, and keep loving. It's the love and support we give and receive that truly shapes our lives.",
