I remember one of them, Old Joe, had been around forever. He was a legend. Anyway, during training, we learned everything from basic firefighting techniques to how to handle the equipment. It was all so new and exciting. You had to be on your toes, no slacking. Oh, and the camaraderie! We were like a family. We had this one exercise where we had to climb the ladder, and boy, was I scared of heights back then! But everyone cheered me on. Good times, really.",

But every challenge was also an opportunity to learn, to grow, and to become better at what we did. I suppose the biggest challenge was always the unpredictability of it all. You never knew what the next call would be or how serious it might turn out. There were times when I felt like I was living on the edge, but it was that adrenaline and the sense of purpose that kept me going. And, of course, the physical demands were tough, especially as I got older. But I always found a way to push through. I guess that's one thing I learned — resilience. And as much as the job was tough, I wouldn't trade those experiences for anything. They shaped who I am today.",
