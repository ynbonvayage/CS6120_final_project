After the fire, there was a sense of loss that was hard to shake. We had to support each other emotionally and find ways to rebuild, both our spirits and our livelihoods. For me, it was particularly tough because my pottery was my main source of income. I remember feeling quite lost and uncertain about the future. We organized fundraisers to gather some money to rebuild, but it was a slow and painful process. Some members of the commune decided to leave, feeling that it was time to move on. Personally, I stayed, determined to help reconstruct what we had lost. I poured my grief into my work, creating pieces that were more raw and emotional. It was a period of deep introspection, and I think it made me a stronger person in many ways.",

It resonated with many people, not just within the commune but beyond, perhaps because we were all going through some form of personal rebirth after the tragedy.

I started experimenting with different techniques that required less strain on my hands, like hand-building instead of using the wheel. It was slower, but it allowed me to continue creating. I also began teaching pottery classes, which was a wonderful way to share my passion with others and keep my connection to the craft alive.
