Sometimes, I'd help her organize the shelves, and she'd reward me with extra borrowing privileges. I remember how different it was back then, without any of the noise and technology we see today.

And I do wonder sometimes, what happened to all those people who used to come in regularly? Did they find new places, new havens? I hope they did. It's strange, isn't it, how a building can hold so much? Not just books, but memories. I still like to think of all the people who found solace or a moment of joy in those walls.
