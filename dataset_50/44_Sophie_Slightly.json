The head housekeeper was a stickler for detail, but she taught me a lot about the importance of presentation and cleanliness. I also met so many interesting people from all walks of life. You know, sometimes I think about how different things were back then, especially with all the technology we have now. Oh, and the uniforms... they were these crisp, white dresses that were quite the bother to keep spotless!",

You know, with comfy furniture, fresh flowers, and homemade breakfast treats. I think it was important for guests to feel relaxed and cherished. I remember spending hours choosing the right color schemes and decor to make each room special. It was a creative outlet for me, really. Sometimes I'd get carried away with little details, like finding the perfect teacup set. Oh, and the garden! I can't forget the garden. I planted roses and lavender, just like my grandmother used to have. The fragrance on a summer morning is something else. It's these little touches that I think make a stay memorable. Anyway, creating that sense of home and warmth was my goal, and I think I managed to achieve it.",

You know, in a hotel, there's a whole team of people to handle different aspects, but with a B&B, it's much more hands-on. I have to juggle everything from cooking breakfast to checking in guests, and sometimes even fixing a leaky tap! It's a bit like being a jack-of-all-trades, really. I think what's most different is the personal connection with guests. In hotels, everything can feel a bit impersonal, but here, I get to know my guests, hear their stories, and sometimes even form friendships. It's rewarding in a way that's hard to put into words. Of course, it can be exhausting at times, especially when we have a full house, but the satisfaction of knowing you've made someone feel at home is worth it. And, oh, talking about making people feel at home, there was this one couple from France... but perhaps that's a story for another time. Anyway, it's been an adventure, that's for sure.",
