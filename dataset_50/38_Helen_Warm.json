Working in magazines taught me to value the nuances of language and the importance of perspective. Now, as a reader, I find myself savoring the way authors weave narratives and create vivid images with their words. There's a certain beauty in the simplicity of just reading for pleasure, without an agenda or deadline. It's a gift to be able to lose myself in a story and be transported to another world, just as we hoped to do for our readers back in those magazine days.",
