It taught me the importance of listening to younger voices and being open to new ideas, even when they challenged the status quo. Another lesson that stands out is the value of resilience. There were many times when progress seemed impossible, but those were the moments that required the most patience and determination. These stories remind me that while the path wasn't always easy, it was always worthwhile.",
