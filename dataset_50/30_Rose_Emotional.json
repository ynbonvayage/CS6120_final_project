I think it's made me more appreciative of the quieter, simpler moments in life. Each season brings its own challenges and rewards, much like the different stages of my own journey. There's something incredibly grounding about digging your hands into the earth and being a part of that cycle. It's given me a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of all living things and the importance of nurturing not just plants, but relationships and passions too.",

Life, like a garden, requires time, care, and resilience. There will be setbacks, but each one is an opportunity to learn and grow. I've also come to realize the value of collaboration and empathy. Whether you're working in the Amazon or your own backyard, the connections you make and the kindness you show can create ripples of change. So, I suppose my advice would be to nurture your passions and relationships, stay open to learning from every experience, and never underestimate the impact of your actions, no matter how small they may seem.",
