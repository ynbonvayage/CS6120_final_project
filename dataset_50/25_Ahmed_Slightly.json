But, you know, the traffic was really something else, and trying to navigate through it was an art form in itself. People sometimes forget how different the city was back then. There were no GPS devices like today, so you really had to know your way around. I used to keep a map in the car just in case.",

That was quite a change from when we used to jot down fares in a little notebook, but oh, the real big shift came later on. You know, when those ride-sharing apps started popping up. I didn't know what to make of it at first. It felt like the whole world was turning upside down. Suddenly, everyone was a taxi driver, and it just wasn't the same. The competition grew fierce, and it was hard to keep up with the new technology. I even thought about trying it myself, but, you know, it just felt different.
