We had to get our hands on new diagnostic tools and learn to read those computer codes. It was both daunting and exciting. But the real kicker was when I went for my first training session on computerized engines. It felt like stepping into a new world.

The first couple of sessions, I felt like a deer caught in headlights! Then there was the matter of the tools. We had to invest in new diagnostic equipment, and those weren't cheap.

You couldn't just listen to the engine anymore; you had to understand what the computer was telling you. I spent many late nights just poring over manuals. The other challenge? Well, it was convincing customers. They were used to seeing us with wrenches and grease, and now we had laptops on our workbenches.

I remember this one fellow, a long-time customer, who had a persistent issue with stalling. We plugged in the scanner, and it quickly pointed to a faulty sensor.
