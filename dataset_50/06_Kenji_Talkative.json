In both fields, you start with an idea or a seed, and through planning, effort, and a bit of trial and error, you nurture it into something tangible and impactful.

Both have their own kind of rhythm and require you to adapt to changing conditions. I think the biggest similarity is the satisfaction that comes from seeing your hard work pay off.

In gardening, it's about understanding that nature has its own schedule and learning to work with it rather than against it. Both require a willingness to learn continuously and to be patient with the process. The journey taught me that real growth happens over time, not overnight. It's about nurturing ideas, projects, or plants, and understanding that each step is a part of a bigger picture. This perspective has been invaluable, not just in my career but in life as a whole.",
