There's something so satisfying about taking a cold, hard piece of metal and turning it into something beautiful, something that tells a story. I guess, in a way, it helped me find myself again after the accident. Ah, it's funny, sometimes I think about those skyscrapers, standing tall and proud, and I realize that now I get to build my own little worlds, one piece at a time. And, uh, sometimes I wonder if my old pal Joe would be proud. I like to think he'd appreciate the rhythm I've found in this new dance with metal.",

If something feels like it's not working, don't be afraid to try something different. And, uh, appreciate the people around you who support you. Like my wife, she's been my rock through all of this.
