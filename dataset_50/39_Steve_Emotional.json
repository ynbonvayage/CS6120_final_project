It's something that just reverberates through your entire being and reminds you of the power and beauty of these creatures. Another memory is the bond I formed with a young lion cub that was rejected by its mother. I spent countless nights ensuring it was fed and cared for. Watching it grow and eventually thrive in its own exhibit was incredibly rewarding. And, of course, the camaraderie with my colleagues – the shared laughs and the shared struggles. It was like a family.",

Working with animals taught me about patience, responsibility, and the delicate balance of nature. I hope future generations understand that conservation isn't just about saving animals; it's about preserving the world we share with them. If we all do our part, however small it might seem, we can make a significant difference. It's about leaving the planet a better place for the lions, for us, and for all who come after.",
