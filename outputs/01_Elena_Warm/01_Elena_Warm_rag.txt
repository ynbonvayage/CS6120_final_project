Reflecting on my journey fills me with a deep sense of gratitude and pride. Each phase of my life brought unique challenges and rewards, and I feel blessed to have had the experiences that shaped my path. It all began when I was just 20 years old, leaving my home in Italy to embark on an exciting but daunting journey to America. The prospect of new opportunities was enticing, even as I felt nervous about leaving behind the familiarity of my homeland.

Upon my arrival, I found solace in my work as a seamstress, a skill I had carried with me from Italy. Working in the shop was comforting and gradually allowed me to build my confidence. As the years passed, I became more skilled, and the shop owners took note of my abilities. They entrusted me with additional responsibilities, even involving me in decision-making processes. This acknowledgment of my skills and input was empowering, and it fueled my passion for advocacy.

By the late 70s, in my 30s, the conditions at the shop were becoming tougher, creating a need for better representation. Encouraged by my colleagues, I stepped into the role of a union representative. This period was filled with hard work—attending meetings, negotiating with management, and advocating for fair wages and better working hours. It was a demanding role, but it was immensely rewarding. I learned the importance of leadership and solidarity, feeling a strong sense of responsibility knowing that people were counting on me to fight for their rights. Improving conditions for my colleagues felt like a way of giving back to the community that had supported me.

After spending many years on the front lines advocating for my colleagues, transitioning to teaching was a natural progression for me. I started by offering small sewing classes in my community, sharing the basics with those eager to learn. It was wonderful to witness the joy and confidence it brought to others, particularly young people and novices who had never sewn before. Teaching sewing became a joy because it allowed me to share a part of myself with others and to see them create something with their own hands—something they could take pride in.

Through teaching, I not only imparted a skill but saw countless individuals find confidence and joy in sewing. I believe that when you share your knowledge and skills, you empower others, and I take immense satisfaction in knowing that I've contributed to this positive impact. 

Looking back, I see a life rich with relationships built and knowledge shared. I've learned the power of perseverance and kindness, and I hope that the legacy I leave behind reflects these values. Each step of my journey, from immigrating to America, advocating for workers' rights, and teaching sewing, has been about standing up for what I believe in and nurturing community connections. As I reflect on my life, I feel content with how things have turned out, filled with gratitude for the opportunities and the people who have been part of my story.
