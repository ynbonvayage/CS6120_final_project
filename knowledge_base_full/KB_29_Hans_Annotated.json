These clocks have been around for generations, some longer than I've been alive, yet they keep on ticking, marking the passage of time. It's humbling. Standing in their presence, I often think about my own time, what's left, and how I choose to spend it. Working with them has taught me patience and the value of living in the moment.

It's easy to get caught up in the rush, but if you listen closely, much like my father used to say, 'The clock will tell you what it needs.' In those quiet moments, there's clarity. Treasure the details, the stories they hold, and the time you have, for it's precious and fleeting.",
